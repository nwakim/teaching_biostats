Often, the bias comes from specific beliefs that weight is inherently something that can be controlled, that fat people use more resources, or that they are lazy. Thus leading to a preference for thin people over fat people. In Project Implicit's research, implicit association tests (IAT) measure the level of stereotype and preference from one demographic group over another. In their Weight IAT dataset, the implicit bias preferring thin people over fat people is measured. The primary outcome is the IAT score, which is a calculated score using Project Implicit's D600 algorithm, measuring the implicit bias through the response time [@greenwald2003]. Predictor variables include demographic variables (age, race, education, gender, and BMI) and social views (including self-perception of weight, controllability of weight, awareness of social standards, and internalization of societal standards). The raw data sample includes $n=??$ participants and a total of $??$ variables.\n\n### Basic info\n\n| Study Design | Topic                                                                           |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Survey??     | What weight-related attitudes and beliefs contribute to implicit anti-fat bias? |\n\nIt is important to note that the dataset is a convenience sample.

Banaji (Harvard University), Dr. Anthony G. Greenwald (University of Washington), and Dr. Brian Nosek (University of Virginia). The project aims to research \"implicit social cognition,\" essentially the implicit, unconscious feelings that people have toward others [@project]. They use an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure \"attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or unable to report\" with 15 different studies [@project].\n\nThis dataset on anti-fat bias is derived from one of the many testing options in Project Implicit.\n\n### How the Implicit Association Test works\n\nBelow is an excerpt from the [Project Implicit page](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/iatdetails.html):\n\n> The IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., black people, gay people) and evaluations (e.g., good, bad) or stereotypes (e.g., athletic, clumsy). The main idea is that making a response is easier when closely related items share the same response key.\n>\n> When doing an IAT you are asked to quickly sort words into categories that are on the left and right hand side of the computer screen by pressing the \"e\" key if the word belongs to the category on the left and the \"i\" key if the word belongs to the category on the right. The IAT has five main parts.\n>\n> In the first part of the IAT you sort words relating to the concepts (e.g., fat people, thin people) into categories. So if the category \"Fat People\" was on the left, and a picture of a heavy person appeared on the screen, you would press the \"e\" key.\n>\n> In the second part of the IAT you sort words relating to the evaluation (e.g., good, bad). So if the category \"good\" was on the left, and a pleasant word appeared on the screen, you would press the \"e\" key.\n>\n> In the third part of the IAT the categories are combined and you are asked to sort both concept and evaluation words. So the categories on the left hand side would be Fat People/Good and the categories on the right hand side would be Thin People/Bad. It is important to note that the order in which the blocks are presented varies across participants, so some people will do the Fat People/Good, Thin People/Bad part first and other people will do the Fat People/Bad, Thin People/Good part first.\n>\n> In the fourth part of the IAT the placement of the concepts switches. If the category \"Fat People\" was previously on the left, now it would be on the right. Importantly, the number of trials in this part of the IAT is increased in order to minimize the effects of practice.\n>\n> In the final part of the IAT the categories are combined in a way that is opposite what they were before. If the category on the left was previously Fat People/Good, it would now be Fat People/Bad.\n>\n> The IAT score is based on how long it takes a person, on average, to sort the words in the third part of the IAT versus the fifth part of the IAT. We would say that one has an implicit preference for thin people relative to fat people if they are faster to categorize words when Thin People and Good share a response key and Fat People and Bad share a response key, relative to the reverse.\n\n## Important Definitions\n\n-   **Anti-fat bias:** discrimination based on a person's body weight, specifically stigma placed on individuals deemed \"fat\"\n\n-   \n\n## Objective\n\nThe objective of this dataset depends on the classroom in which it is used. In Linear Regression, we aim to find the association between the IAT score (outcome) and various demographics (including BMI) and weight-related attitudes and beliefs. In an Introductory course, we can examine the distribution and statistics of the IAT score itself.\n\n## Questions/Activities for Students\n\n-   **Activity:** Have the students take the test! You can go to the [Project Implicit website](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/research/), register, and select a specific test to take.\n    -   Once registered, you can click \"Take a Test,\" read the Preliminary Information, and then click \"I wish to proceed\" at the bottom.\n    -   Then you can click the button \"Weight IAT\" to take this particular test.\n-   Activity: Discuss the validity of the test (big pop culture topic)\n    -   If not generalizable to public, what claims can we make from our analysis?\n-   Activity: Discuss our independence assumption in Linear Regression\n    -   Can people take this test more than once? Are multiple tests from one person independent?\n\n## Subjects and Variables\n\n## Data Access\n\nData can be accessed [here](https://osf.io/iay3x/).
