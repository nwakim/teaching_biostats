I create content in the classroom to improve accessibility and interest for all students. This site contains the dataset repository that connects publicly available datasets to statistics educators so that they can easily search for datasets, with included activities, to use in their classrooms. **Please use these datasets responsibly. I have worked to provide unique guidelines for each dataset.**\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
