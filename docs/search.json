There are articles and datasets referenced that may include triggering words referring to fat people.\nI use the term “fat people” as a neutral term to identify people who have larger bodies.\nI have chosen to use this term based on preferences voiced by fat public figures in the media. Please know that I bring my own bias to the media that I consume.\nData used in my classroom were from the 2021 dataset.\nThis dataset and framed analysis is heavily derived from a publication on implicit and explicit anti-fat bias (Elran-Barak and Bar-Anan 2018). Dr. Elran-Barak and Dr. Bar-Anon approach the data with several social theoretical models and with discussion on statistical considerations and consequences.

    "text": "Abstract\nAnti-fat bias stems from specific attitudes and beliefs that stigmatize fat people as less than their thinner alternatives. Often, the bias comes from specific beliefs that weight is inherently something that can be controlled, that fat people use more resources, or that they are lazy. Thus leading to a preference for thin people over fat people. In Project Implicit’s research, implicit association tests (IAT) measure the level of stereotype and preference from one demographic group over another. In their Weight IAT dataset, the implicit bias preferring thin people over fat people is measured. The primary outcome is the IAT score, which is a calculated score using Project Implicit’s D600 algorithm, measuring the implicit bias through the response time (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003). Predictor variables include demographic variables (age, race, education, gender, and BMI) and social views (including self-perception of weight, controllability of weight, awareness of social standards, and internalization of societal standards). The raw data sample includes \\(n=??\\) participants and a total of \\(??\\) variables.\n\nBasic info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Design\nTopic\n\n\n\n\nSurvey??\nWhat weight-related attitudes and beliefs contribute to implicit anti-fat bias?\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the dataset is a convenience sample. Participants are not randomly selected, but self-selected. “Recruitment occurred via media coverage, links from other sites, links provided by search engines, and word-of-mouth” (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003). From there, participants could choose to visit the cite and participate. This means “respondent samples for this research cannot be treated as representative of any definable population.” (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003) Also, there is no control for multiple participation. Thus, an individual can participate in the study multiple times leading to observations that are not independent. “However, the overall large number of respondents reduces the potential impact of this problem – few, if any, single respondents could plausibly have provided as much as 0.1% (e.g., 10 in 10,000 observations) of any of the data sets.” (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses/Course Content\nSpecific statistical topics\nSpecific social implications topics\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive statistics\n\n\n\n\nBasic Inference\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression\nMissingness\nIssues with independence"

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nThese data are a part of Project Implicit, a non-profit organization co-founded by Dr. Mahzarin R. Banaji (Harvard University), Dr. Anthony G. Greenwald (University of Washington), and Dr. Brian Nosek (University of Virginia). The project aims to research “implicit social cognition,” essentially the implicit, unconscious feelings that people have toward others (“Project Implicit,” n.d.). They use an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure “attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or unable to report” with 15 different studies (“Project Implicit,” n.d.).\nThis dataset on anti-fat bias is derived from one of the many testing options in Project Implicit.\n\nHow the Implicit Association Test works\nBelow is an excerpt from the Project Implicit page:\n\nThe IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., black people, gay people) and evaluations (e.g., good, bad) or stereotypes (e.g., athletic, clumsy). The main idea is that making a response is easier when closely related items share the same response key.\nWhen doing an IAT you are asked to quickly sort words into categories that are on the left and right hand side of the computer screen by pressing the “e” key if the word belongs to the category on the left and the “i” key if the word belongs to the category on the right. The IAT has five main parts.\nIn the first part of the IAT you sort words relating to the concepts (e.g., fat people, thin people) into categories. So if the category “Fat People” was on the left, and a picture of a heavy person appeared on the screen, you would press the “e” key.\nIn the second part of the IAT you sort words relating to the evaluation (e.g., good, bad). So if the category “good” was on the left, and a pleasant word appeared on the screen, you would press the “e” key.\nIn the third part of the IAT the categories are combined and you are asked to sort both concept and evaluation words. So the categories on the left hand side would be Fat People/Good and the categories on the right hand side would be Thin People/Bad. It is important to note that the order in which the blocks are presented varies across participants, so some people will do the Fat People/Good, Thin People/Bad part first and other people will do the Fat People/Bad, Thin People/Good part first.\nIn the fourth part of the IAT the placement of the concepts switches. If the category “Fat People” was previously on the left, now it would be on the right. Importantly, the number of trials in this part of the IAT is increased in order to minimize the effects of practice.\nIn the final part of the IAT the categories are combined in a way that is opposite what they were before. If the category on the left was previously Fat People/Good, it would now be Fat People/Bad.\nThe IAT score is based on how long it takes a person, on average, to sort the words in the third part of the IAT versus the fifth part of the IAT. We would say that one has an implicit preference for thin people relative to fat people if they are faster to categorize words when Thin People and Good share a response key and Fat People and Bad share a response key, relative to the reverse."

The opposing viewpoints discuss the overutilization of implicit bias as it intersects with race and DEIJ in general.\nThis section will introduce us to a few articles that oppose implicit bias tests (or the IAT directly). The aim of this section is to understand critics of IAT: what and how they think. This will help us thoughtfully consider their arguments and work towards parsing out the truth behind the data. If you feel up to reading these article, I highly recommend it! However, these articles discuss the invalidity of implicit bias in the context of race. If you wish to avoid exposure to racist writing, please see my bulleted synopses below.\n\nVox article (2017)\n\nIn my opinion, this article seems more level-headed than the next article\nThere is a lot of work that shows sweeping claims and large conclusions from IAT are debunked\n\nHowever, we can make modest claims from the IAT\n\nThe IAT should not be used on the individual level\n\nYour individual results will vary: showing no bias, bias in one direction, and then bias in another\nIAT is better used at a population level\n\nAttempting to reduce implicit bias is not the best way to reduce racism: more structural and explicit changes need to be made\nMy response to this article:\n\nWe need note potential limitations including generalizability of IAT results\nNeed to bring IAT into context: By exposing implicit bias, we can validate experiences and promote structural changes\n\n\nPsychology Today Article (2022)\n\nIn my opinion, this article aims to be edgy and evoke an emotional response. Please read with caution.\nTalks about implicit bias tests in general and also the IAT\nImplicit bias does not have an agreed upon definition.\nIAT measures reaction time as a poor proxy for bias\n\nCan’t help myself from making a comment: Psychology research is FULL of proxies - it is very hard to directly measure unconscious thoughts and behavior!!\n\nMy response to this article:\n\nIt ended up giving me a great source of articles that talk about the limitations of implicit bias research!\n\nI think it’s important to read articles from scholars who have issues with the measurement validity and results. This is the best way to make my research more impenetrable to criticism."
