    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAnti-fat bias stems from specific attitudes and beliefs that stigmatize fat people as less than their thinner alternatives. Often, the bias comes from specific beliefs that weight is inherently something that can be controlled, that fat people use more resources, or that they are lazy. Thus leading to a preference for thin people over fat people. In Project Implicit’s research, implicit association tests (IAT) measure the level of stereotype and preference from one demographic group over another. In their Weight IAT dataset, the implicit bias preferring thin people over fat people is measured. The primary outcome is the IAT score, which is a calculated score using Project Implicit’s D600 algorithm, measuring the implicit bias through the response time (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003). Predictor variables include demographic variables (age, race, education, gender, and BMI) and social views (including self-perception of weight, controllability of weight, awareness of social standards, and internalization of societal standards). The raw data sample includes \\(n=??\\) participants and a total of \\(??\\) variables.\n\nBasic info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Design\nTopic\n\n\n\n\nSurvey??\nWhat weight-related attitudes and beliefs contribute to implicit anti-fat bias?\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the dataset is a convenience sample. Participants are not randomly selected, but self-selected. “Recruitment occurred via media coverage, links from other sites, links provided by search engines, and word-of-mouth” (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003). From there, participants could choose to visit the cite and participate. This means “respondent samples for this research cannot be treated as representative of any definable population.” (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003) Also, there is no control for multiple participation. Thus, an individual can participate in the study multiple times leading to observations that are not independent. “However, the overall large number of respondents reduces the potential impact of this problem – few, if any, single respondents could plausibly have provided as much as 0.1% (e.g., 10 in 10,000 observations) of any of the data sets.” (Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji 2003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses/Course Content\nSpecific statistical topics\nSpecific social implications topics\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive statistics\n\n\n\n\nBasic Inference\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression\nMissingness\nIssues with independence"

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nThese data are a part of Project Implicit, a non-profit organization co-founded by Dr. Mahzarin R. Banaji (Harvard University), Dr. Anthony G. Greenwald (University of Washington), and Dr. Brian Nosek (University of Virginia). The project aims to research “implicit social cognition,” essentially the implicit, unconscious feelings that people have toward others (“Project Implicit,” n.d.). They use an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure “attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or unable to report” with 15 different studies (“Project Implicit,” n.d.).\nThis dataset on anti-fat bias is derived from one of the many testing options in Project Implicit.\n\nHow the Implicit Association Test works\nBelow is an excerpt from the Project Implicit page:\n\nThe IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., black people, gay people) and evaluations (e.g., good, bad) or stereotypes (e.g., athletic, clumsy). The main idea is that making a response is easier when closely related items share the same response key.\nWhen doing an IAT you are asked to quickly sort words into categories that are on the left and right hand side of the computer screen by pressing the “e” key if the word belongs to the category on the left and the “i” key if the word belongs to the category on the right. The IAT has five main parts.\nIn the first part of the IAT you sort words relating to the concepts (e.g., fat people, thin people) into categories. So if the category “Fat People” was on the left, and a picture of a heavy person appeared on the screen, you would press the “e” key.\nIn the second part of the IAT you sort words relating to the evaluation (e.g., good, bad). So if the category “good” was on the left, and a pleasant word appeared on the screen, you would press the “e” key.\nIn the third part of the IAT the categories are combined and you are asked to sort both concept and evaluation words. So the categories on the left hand side would be Fat People/Good and the categories on the right hand side would be Thin People/Bad. It is important to note that the order in which the blocks are presented varies across participants, so some people will do the Fat People/Good, Thin People/Bad part first and other people will do the Fat People/Bad, Thin People/Good part first.\nIn the fourth part of the IAT the placement of the concepts switches. If the category “Fat People” was previously on the left, now it would be on the right. Importantly, the number of trials in this part of the IAT is increased in order to minimize the effects of practice.\nIn the final part of the IAT the categories are combined in a way that is opposite what they were before. If the category on the left was previously Fat People/Good, it would now be Fat People/Bad.\nThe IAT score is based on how long it takes a person, on average, to sort the words in the third part of the IAT versus the fifth part of the IAT. We would say that one has an implicit preference for thin people relative to fat people if they are faster to categorize words when Thin People and Good share a response key and Fat People and Bad share a response key, relative to the reverse."

Under “Weight IAT 2004-2022” there are several drop down menus:\n\nI opened the first “Datasets & Codebooks,” then selected “OSF Storage (United States).” Once selected, the “Download as zip” option pops up in the top right part of the Files section.\n\nYou can download any year’s dataset. All my material is drawn from the 2021 dataset.\nCSV and SAV (SPSS) files are available. You will need to unzip the folder and files before use. Please see my teaching materials for how I accessed the files within R."

Within each dataset page, I have included some references to get you started on this.\nThis repository is not meant to be the only resource or attempt to do the work of other, existing resources. There are many wonderful, socially inclined resources (like ICSPR) and statistically inclined resources, and teaching inclined resources. I hope to connect these three areas to make a repository that helps connect professors teaching statistics with statistical lessons and activities using socially motivated datasets that are publicly available.\nPlease note that I am NOT formally trained in the social sciences. For many of these datasets, I have asked colleagues who are experts in the respective fields to collaborate and critique my work.\nFinally, I am only ONE person. I am most certainly bringing bias into this work. I have tried to counter my bias by collaborating with others, incorporating others’ experiences, and researching various opinions. I encourage you to question my statements and perform your own research on each dataset."
